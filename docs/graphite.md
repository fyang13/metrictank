# Graphite

Metrictank aims to be a drop-in replacement for Graphite, but also to address a few of Graphite's shortcomings.
Here are some important functional differences to keep in mind:
(we specifically do not go into subjective things like performance or scalability here)

* currently no support for rewriting old data; for a given key and timestamp first write wins, not last. We aim to fix this.
* timeseries can change resolution (interval) over time, they will be merged seamlessly at read time.
* multiple rollup functions are supported and can be selected via consolidateBy() at query time. (except when using functions which change the nature of the data such as perSecond() etc)
* xFilesfactor is currently not supported
* will never move observations into the past (e.g. consolidation and rollups will only cause data to get an equal or higher timestamp)
* graphite timezone defaults to Chicago, we default to server time
* many functions are not implemented yet in metrictank itself, but it autodetects this and will proxy requests it cannot handle to graphite-web
  (which then uses metrictank as a simple backend).  See below for details



## Processing functions

Metrictank aims to be able to provide as much processing power as it can: we're in the process
of implementing [Graphite's extensive processing api](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html) into metrictank itself.

Below is an overview of all current Graphite functions (as of Aug 15, 2018) and their support in metrictank.
There are 3 levels of support:

* No : not implemented yet in metrictank or not applicable (e.g. graphite functions that affect graphical style but not json data)
* Stable : 100% compatible with graphite and vetted
* Unstable: not fully compatible yet or not vetted enough

When you request functions that metrictank cannot provide, it will automatically proxy requests to graphite for a seamless failover.
You can also choose to enable unstable functions via process=any
